## How to get started
- Open the folder you want the repository in
    - Open terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/PIMOSH-Network/pimoshWebsite.git`
        - It will clone all the files to your local computer. You should be able to see the same files in GitHub
- Install Node modules
    - You would need `Node.js` for this
    - In terminal run: `npm install`
        - It will download a folder labeled `node_modules`. Once you see this file, you don't necessarily need to run 'npm install' again.
- Run nodemon
    - In terminal, run: `npx nodemon app`
- Open your browser and type in `localhost:3000` 
    - You should be able to see the website
